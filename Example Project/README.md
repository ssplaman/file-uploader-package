## Usage

The main application imports the `file-uploader-plugin` package and renders it in [`App.tsx`](src/App.tsx):

```tsx
import FileUpload from 'file-uploader-plugin';

const App = () => (
  <FileUpload />
);

export default App;
```

## Installing the Local Plugin

To use the local version of the file uploader plugin instead of an npm-published version:

1. **Uninstall the npm package** from the main project:

  ```sh
  npm uninstall file-uploader-plugin
  ```

2. **Link the local package** by installing it directly from the local folder:

  ```sh
  npm install "../"
  ```

3. Now, the example project will use the local build of the package. Any changes you make to the package source code (in `File Uploader Package/src/`) should be followed by running the build script in the package directory:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

4. After building, your changes will be reflected in the example project.

## Development Workflow for the Plugin

1. Edit the source files in file-uploader-package/src/

2. Build the plugin:

  ```sh
  cd ..
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

3. Return to Example Project, and restart the dev server if needed
